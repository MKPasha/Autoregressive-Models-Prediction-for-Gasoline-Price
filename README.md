# Autoregressive Models: Prediction for Gasoline Price
In this project, my aim is to create an autoregressive (AR) model to predict the weekly retail price for Gasoline per Gallon in the US. The dataset is given here https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=w. It contains prices ($) of gasoline from every week dating back to April 1993.
